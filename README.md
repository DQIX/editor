# DQIX Editor

A save editor for dragon quest ix

## Looking for maintainers

I can no longer work on this, if you're interested in taking ownership of it, please create an Issue.
The editor as it stands is basically complete, however I cannot resolve any future issues, and there are a few things yet to be added.

## for devs

- `src/game/data.js` contains game data info including items, equipment, appearance data, etc
- `src/game/grotto.js` contains a partial implementation of the grotto generation algorithms
- `src/game/layout.js` contains known values of where various things in the save file are, if you find something else please feel free to open an issue or pr
- `src/saveManager.js` contains an implementation of reading and writing various data from the save file, except for grottos which is done in `src/game/grotto.js`
